## FAQ

**Q: Can I use this in my company for internal tools?**
A: Yes, internal use is permitted under AGPL-3.0 as long as you don't distribute the software or offer it as a service.

**Q: I'm building a SaaS product. Do I need a commercial license?**
A: If your SaaS uses these frameworks and you cannot comply with AGPL-3.0 source disclosure requirements, yes.

**Q: Can I use this for client projects?**
A: If you're delivering proprietary software to clients, you'll need a commercial license.
